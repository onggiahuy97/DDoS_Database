DDoS attack on Database System

### Short Paper: IP spoofing detection for preventing DDoS attack in Cloud Computing
Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7073820
DDoS attacks in Cloud Computing, characterized by IP spoofing, are a major security threat. This paper proposes host-based OS fingerprinting, combining passive and active methods, to detect spoofed IP packets and enhance security.


## Proxy Service 
What is Database Proxy Service? 
A database proxy intercepts all communication between applications and the database, allowing you to:
1. Monitor and control traffic before it reach the database 
2. Modify or reject queries that might be harmful or inefficient 
3. Balance load across multiple database instances 
4. Cache results to reduce database load 
5. Implement security policies uniformly across all applications.
