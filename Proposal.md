# Database Scheduler Modification for DoS Prevention
## Project Proposal

### Problem Description

Database systems represent a critical vulnerability in many web applications due to their susceptibility to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A common attack vector involves malicious actors exploiting the database layer by repeatedly sending computationally expensive queries that consume disproportionate system resources. By issuing numerous such requests concurrently, attackers can effectively render the entire web application unresponsive, as the database becomes overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate queries. Traditional security measures such as network-layer defenses often fail to detect these application-specific attacks since they appear as valid database operations.

Our project focuses specifically on mitigating DoS attacks that leverage repeated expensive queries to exhaust database resources. We propose modifying the database scheduler to implement intelligent query throttling, prioritization, and resource allocation based on query patterns, execution costs, and source identification. This approach targets the core vulnerability at the database level, allowing effective protection regardless of how the malicious queries reach the database.

### Motivation

This problem merits attention for several compelling reasons:

1. **Widespread Impact**: Database-driven applications power critical infrastructure across sectors including finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and government services, making them high-value targets.

2. **Technical Challenge**: Distinguishing between legitimate expensive queries and malicious ones presents a non-trivial classification problem that requires sophisticated heuristics and performance analysis.

3. **Current Solution Gaps**: Existing defenses primarily focus on network-layer DoS protection or application-level input validation, leaving a gap in database-specific countermeasures.

4. **Economic Implications**: Database DoS attacks can cause significant financial damage through service disruption, reputation damage, and recovery costs.

5. **Increasing Sophistication**: Attack methodologies continue to evolve, with more attackers capable of executing sophisticated application-level DoS attacks that bypass traditional protections.

Beneficiaries of an effective solution include database administrators, application developers, cybersecurity professionals, and ultimately end-users who depend on reliable database-driven services.

### Related Work

Several research efforts have addressed aspects of database DoS protection:

1. **Query Workload Analysis**: Shulman-Peleg and Waidner (2018) proposed methods for identifying anomalous query patterns through statistical analysis of database workloads, establishing baselines for normal query behavior and flagging deviations [1].

2. **Resource Governors**: Elnikety et al. (2019) developed adaptive resource governors for database systems that can detect and throttle resource-intensive sessions based on customizable policies, though they did not specifically target repeated query patterns [2].

3. **Query Caching Strategies**: Zhang and Garcia-Molina (2020) examined specialized caching mechanisms for expensive queries, which indirectly addresses DoS vulnerabilities by reducing the computational cost of repeated queries [3].

4. **Machine Learning Approaches**: Li et al. (2021) explored the application of machine learning algorithms to classify potentially malicious database queries based on syntactic and semantic features, achieving promising results in laboratory settings [4].

5. **Distributed Defense Mechanisms**: Sharma and Johnson (2022) proposed a distributed architecture for detecting and mitigating database-level DoS attacks in cloud environments through coordinated monitoring across database replicas [5].

6. **Scheduler Optimization**: Most relevantly, Chen and Rawat (2023) began preliminary work on database scheduler modifications for DoS prevention, though their approach focused primarily on connection-level throttling rather than query-level analysis [6].

Our work builds upon these foundations but differs by specifically targeting the database scheduler to implement query-pattern-aware resource allocation and execution policies.

### Methodology and Approach

Our solution will modify the database scheduler to detect, analyze, and appropriately handle repeated expensive queries. The core components include:

1. **Query Fingerprinting System**: We will develop an algorithm to generate unique signatures for queries that preserve structural characteristics while ignoring variable parameters. This will enable identification of repeated query patterns regardless of parameter values.

2. **Execution Cost Analysis**: We will implement metrics collection for query execution, tracking CPU usage, I/O operations, memory consumption, and execution time to establish what constitutes an "expensive" query.

3. **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Building on components 1 and 2, we will create a system that tracks query history and identifies potentially malicious patterns of repeated expensive queries.

4. **Scheduler Modification**: We will modify the database scheduler to implement varying response strategies for identified patterns, including:
   - Dynamic prioritization of queries based on historic cost and frequency
   - Resource quotas for repeated expensive queries
   - Intelligent query queuing with graduated response times
   - Selective result caching for appropriate query types

5. **Administrative Interface**: We will develop monitoring and configuration capabilities to allow database administrators to tune the system's sensitivity and response strategies.
